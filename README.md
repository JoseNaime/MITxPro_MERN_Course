# MIT xPro MERN Course 
In this repository you can find all references to the repositories I developed along with the MIT xPro - Full Stack MERN course

## Repositories
- [ToDo](https://github.com/JoseNaime/ToDo-list): In this web application, you're able to create your own To-Do list
- [Real Time Bus Tracker](https://github.com/JoseNaime/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker): This project helps you to follow the track of one of the busses passing through MIT and Harvard. Select one track id from the left menu and follow the trajectory in realtime
- [Eyes](https://github.com/JoseNaime/Eyes): Two eyes will follow your mouse cursor while you move it around.
- [PacMen](https://github.com/JoseNaime/PacMen): What if Pac-man was able to move freely? Or better, what if a ton of Pac-men were able to do it?
